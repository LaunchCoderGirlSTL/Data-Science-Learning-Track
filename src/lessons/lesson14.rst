Lesson 14: Neural Networks Part 1
=================================

Learning Objectives
-------------------

* Understanding the idea of non-linear hypotheses
* Examples of computer vision problems
* Understanding the basic architecture of a neural network: input layer, hidden layer(s) and output layer
* Understanding the elements that goes into each layer (e.g. activiation function (a^j) and weight matrix \theta^j that maps layer j to layer j+1)
* NN application for non-linear classification
* NN application for multi-class classification
