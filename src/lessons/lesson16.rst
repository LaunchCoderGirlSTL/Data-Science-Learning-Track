Lesson 16: Bias/Variance Tradeoff
=================================

Learning Objectives
-------------------

* Name five parameters you can change when troubleshooting errors in model predictions
* Describe the training & testing procedure for hypothesis testing a model
* Describe how to compute the test set error for both linear regression and logistic regression models and know the general formula for each.
* Describe why the train/validation/test procedure is necessary for model selection. What is the parameter that this framework will avoid over-fitting to the test set?
* Be able to diagnose if your model is performing poorly due to bias or overfitting
* Describe how to select the regularization parameter, lambda.
* For each of the (five) parameters you can tune for the model, describe which will improve model performance with respect to high variance or high bias.
